# CSINTSY MC01 - Gold Miner Version 2.4
MC01. A Java Program that showcases AI capabilities using Breath-first Search as an algorithm for a Miner looking for a hidden gold in a grid. This Machine Project was submitted to Mrs. Judith Azcarraga as partial completion for the course CSINTSY at De La Salle University. My coworker for this project is Jordan Sibug.


## Downloading the JAR File
1. Make sure that Java is installed already (Must be Version 11 or up). You may download Java 11 [here](https://www.oracle.com/ph/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html). 
2. Download the JAR file at http://bit.ly/CSINTSY-GoldMiner
3. After download is finished, you may run it by double-clicking the application. Treat it as an exe file.

## Running the Source Code
1. This project was built using the IntelliJ IDEA. Instructions will be clearer if executed using that IDE. Nonetheless, It should be opened through other IDEs.
2. You may choose to download the source code through zipping the file or cloning the repository.
3. Once done downloading, open the folder as project.
4. Run the main function located at **Driver.java** (src/game/Driver.java)


### Final Reminders
* This application has been designed specifically for monitors having at least 24 inches. The developers apologize for this. It's still runnable to every computer having Java 11 and up; but the window might be too large for smaller screens. It will still function - It might just be a nuisance for those users with smaller screens.
* Your computer might consider the JAR file a malware since it's a program *not widely known* since we're just students. Disregard any warnings your computer or anti-virus may say. We guarantee that our JAR file has no virus or malicious software embedded to it.
